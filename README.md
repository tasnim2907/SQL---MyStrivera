# SQL — MyStrivera

## Overview

This repository includes SQL practice exercises completed as part of the MyStrivera Data Analytics learning series. The queries focus on strengthening concepts such as subqueries, correlated subqueries, and aggregate functions using a small relational dataset of employees, departments, and regions.

## Key Features

* Covers filtering, aggregation, and grouping using SQL.
* Includes examples of subqueries, `IN`, `ANY`, `ALL`, and correlated subqueries.
* Focused on analytical and interview-style SQL problems.
* Simple dataset to simulate real-world business queries.

## Dataset

The project uses three related tables:

* **employees** – employee details such as salary, department, region, and hire date
* **departments** – department names and associated divisions
* **regions** – identifiers for geographic regions

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Load the dataset into your SQL environment (PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite).
3. Run the queries to explore and modify as needed.
4. Observe how subqueries and aggregate functions interact to produce insights.

## Insights You Can Find

This project highlights how to use SQL to analyze employee and departmental data. You can identify employees earning above averages, compare divisions, find top earners per department, and explore salary trends across regions. The queries build strong foundational understanding for data analysis tasks and SQL interviews.

## Tools & Technologies

* SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL compatible)
* DBeaver, SSMS, or pgAdmin
* Git & GitHub
